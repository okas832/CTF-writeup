Differ with other CTF, SECCON CTF requires to plan who will spend the whole time
on King of the Hill(KotH) challenges. With my pervious outdated experience of
SECCON CTF 2017, we planned to focus more on KotH.

However, the number of challenges was different compared to pervious CTF; SECCON
CTF 2017 had 5 challenges each on geopardy and KotH, meanwhile SECCON CTF 2023
had 15 on geopardy, 3 on KotH and unexpected physical challenges.

The plan was almost perfect, n1net4il and rkm0594 earned lots of points at
SecLang and Witch challenge. However, I failed to get reasonable points from
heptarchy challenge. Decompiling the binary with consideration of libraries is
too hard. (ㅜ.ㅜ)

I thanks to CTF organizers to make good CTF overall. And I learned many new
things from challeges too.
